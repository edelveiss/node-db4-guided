// CREATE TABLES AND FOREIGN KEY RELATIONSHIPS
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------//
// Tables can have 1-to-1, 1-to-many, or many-to-many "relationships". These
// relationships provide value through the ability to 'JOIN' tables. By using a
// primary key value from Table A as the value of a foreign key field in Table
// B, you "relate" the two records, and using JOIN statements, you can combine
// the related data in a SQL query result.
//
// When creating tables, you should create tables that do not have any foreign
// keys *first*. These are tables that are likely to be "parent" (a.k.a.
// "primary") tables that are referred to by other tables (a.k.a. "child"
// tables). For example, if you try to create the [animals] table below, with a
// foreign key field that references the [species] table, but the [species]
// table hasn't been created yet, you will get an error. The [species] table
// needs to be created before you can define a foreign key field in [animals]
// that references it.

        // DEFINING A FOREIGN KEY FIELD USING KNEX - ENSURING
        // REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY
        //------------------------------------------------------------//
        // The "species_id" field is a foreign key field. There are
        // multiple ways to define a foreign key field using knex. They
        // all have these things in common:
        //
        //   1. The field definition identifies the "parent" table, and
        //      the primary key field or column in that parent table
        //      that the foreign key field referenes.
        //   2. The field type must match the field type of the primary
        //      key field in the primary table. Primary keys that are
        //      integers are always *unsigned* (which means that they
        //      are never negative numbers). When defining a matching
        //      foreign key field that will references a primary key
        //      that is an integer, be sure to make it .unsigned().
        //   3. The default behavior of the database when a record is
        //      deleted from the primary table, and the primary key for
        //      that record is used as a foreign key value in other
        //      "child" tables, is to disallow the delete request and
        //      throw an error. This is also true if the primary key
        //      value is *modified* (or updated) - changing a primary
        //      key value has the same effect as deleting the record,
        //      and creating a new record with a different primary key
        //      value. You can override this default "disallow" behavior
        //      by using the .onDelete() and .onUpdate() methods. The
        //      string values you can pass to these methods are outlined
        //      below, where .onDelete() and .onUpdate() are called. See
        //      documentation for the "foreign()" method at
        //      https://knexjs.org.

          // METHODS FOR DEFINING FOREIGN KEYS
          //--------------------------------------------------------//
          // There are 3 ways to define a foreign key column. There
          // are examples of all three below.
          //
          //--------------------------------------------------------//
          // METHOD 1 FOR DEFINING A FOREIGN KEY FIELD
          //--------------------------------------------------------//
          // As below, using the .references() method in the column
          // definition chain (after tbl.integer()). You pass in both
          // the table name and the field name using a "." between
          // them, as below.
          .references("species.id")
          //--------------------------------------------------------//
          // VALUES FOR .onDelete() AND .onUpdate()
          //--------------------------------------------------------//
          // The .onDelete() and .onUpdate() methods allow us to
          // control how the database handles delete and update
          // requests for records with primary keys that are used (or
          // "referred to") by child tables. The following values can
          // be passed in to .onDelete() and .onUpdate():
          //
          //   * RESTRICT - this is the default if you don't call
          //     .onDelete() or .onUpdate(). You may choose to call
          //     those methods and pass 'RESTRICT' anyway, just to
          //     make it clear that you intend for that to be the
          //     behavior (as opposed to just forgetting what the
          //     default behavior is, or unknowingly accepting the
          //     default.)
          //   * CASCADE - this causes the database to find and delete
          //     all records in child tables that reference the
          //     primary record being deleted. The delete request in
          //     the primary table is "cascaded" to all child tables
          //     that reference the priamary record's key. This is the
          //     most destructive option.
          //
          //   * SET NULL - this causes the database to find all
          //     records in child tables that reference the primary
          //     record being deleted, and to set their foreign key
          //     field values to "null" (for the foreign key that
          //     references the record being deleted.) This helps
          //     ensure that there are no child records refer to the
          //     primary record being deleted. NOTE: This coul have
          //     unintended consequences if you have defined a foreign
          //     key field as .notNullable()... be careful!
          //   * NO ACTION - this causes the database to allow the
          //     deletion of the primary record, without taking any
          //     other action.  THIS WILL BREAK REFERENTIAL
          //     INTEGRITY!!! You will have records in child tables
          //     that are referring to a record in a parent table
          //     *that does not exist*. There should be rare, if any,
          //     cases where this is appropriate.
          //
          // Here, we set the delete and update behavior for parent
          // tables to 'CASCADE'.
          //
          .onDelete("CASCADE")
          .onUpdate("CASCADE");

      //----------------------------------------------------------------//
      // CREATE A BRIDGE TABLE FOR *:* RELATIONSHIPS
      //----------------------------------------------------------------//
      // In our example, zoos and animals are related, but there can be
      // many zoos for any given animal, and of course, many animals for
      // any given zoo. Since a foreign key field can only have 1 value,
      // putting foreign key fields in each table won't work. We need a
      // third table. For us, it's the [zoo_animals] table. The convention
      // is to name bridge tables using the names of the 2 tables that the
      // bridge is for. (Could also have been [animal_zoos]... take your
      // pick...)
      //
      // This table will have 2 foreign key fields, one for each of the
      // tables that are being related. Each record in the bridge table
      // will represent a relationship between a record in each parent
      // table.
      //
      // It is possible to have multiple bridge records for the same pair
      // of parent records... it depends on the business logic you need to
      // manage. If you need this capability, each bridge record should
      // have its own primary key, likely defined as an auto-incrementing,
      // unique, unsigned integer.
      //
      // But if only one bridge record should exist for any pair of parent
      // records, you will want to define a "composite primary key" for
      // the bridge table. You can see an example of this below.
      //
      // It completely depends on what the solution should allow...
      .createTable("zoo_animals", (tbl) => {
        //------------------------------------------------------------//
        // METHOD 2 FOR DEFINING A FOREIGN KEY FIELD
        //------------------------------------------------------------//
        // Use the .references() method, but only pass the field name,
        // and then follow it with a call to .inTable(). It's more
        // verbose, and might be harder to read, but it works.
        tbl
          .integer("zoo_id")
          .unsigned()
          .notNullable()
          .references("id")
          .inTable("zoos")
          .onDelete("CASCADE")
          .onUpdate("CASCADE");
        //------------------------------------------------------------//
        // METHOD 3 FOR DEFINING A FOREIGN KEY FIELD
        //------------------------------------------------------------//
        // You can add a foreign key constraint on an existing column
        // using the table.foreign() method. So the third way to create
        // a foreign field is to first define the field, then add the
        // foreign key constraint, as below.
        tbl
          .integer("animal_id")
          .unsigned()
          .notNullable()
          .onDelete("CASCADE")
          .onUpdate("CASCADE");
        tbl.foreign("animal_id").references("animals.id");

        //------------------------------------------------------------//
        // COMPOSITE PRIMARY KEY
        //------------------------------------------------------------//
        // This is an example of a "composite primary key". Instead of
        // having a specific primary key column, you instruct the
        // database to keep track of a primary key for the table
        // internally, and specify that the primary key value is
        // composed of values from other columns in the table. Since
        // primary keys are, by definition, unique, this causes the
        // database to ensure that you can only have 1 record with a
        // specific combination of values in the fields that compose the
        // primary key. For example, the primary key definition below
        // uses zoo_id and animal_id. If a record exists with zoo_id=1
        // and animal_id=1, and an attempt is made to insert *another*
        // record with zoo_id=1 and animal_id=1, the database would fail
        // the insert and return an SQL CONSTRAINT error, indicating
        // that a record with that primary key value already exists. In
        // this way, you can guarantee that certain column value
        // combinations only occur once in your database.
        //
        // In our case, this is desired since we want to keep track of
        // every zoo an animal has visited (no matter how many times the
        // animal has been there)... once we add a record indicating
        // that an animal has been to a zoo, we should not allow the
        // addition of another record with that combination. Making that
        // combination the primary key allows the database to take care
        // of enforcing that for us.
        //
        // Of course, we could take care of this manually through our
        // business logic in the application, but letting the database
        // manage it for us is cleaner and less error prone.
        tbl.primary(["zoo_id", "animal_id"]);
      })
  );
};

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------//
// DEFINE ROLLBACK LOGIC
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------//
// When you define the rollback logic, you must roll things back in reverse
// order. This is especially important when there are foreign key constraints.
// If you tried to drop the [species] table before dropping the [animals] table,
// the foreign key constraint behavior could prevent the drop. If the default
// 'RESTRICT' behavior is in place, dropping [species] before [animals] would
// fail.
